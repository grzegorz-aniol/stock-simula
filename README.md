# stock-simula
Python utility to run simulation on stock exchange data

## Goal of this project
This project has been created mainly in order to achieve two goals:
* practice and learn Python
* perform investment simulations on stock data

## Data source
Data are read from set of CSV files. Each file represents daily prices of one company.
Each row contains:
 * date, 
 * open price, 
 * min price, 
 * max price,
 * close price,

Originally, for my purpose, data are related to polish stock exchange in Warsaw and Polish investment funds.
